Write a web app called Studying Log that allows users to 
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries as 
they study about each topic. The Studying Log home page will 
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once 
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read 
and edit existing entries
